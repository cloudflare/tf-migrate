# Drift Exemptions for zone_setting resource
#
# Resource-specific exemptions for cloudflare_zone_setting
#
# The v4 cloudflare_zone_settings_override resource is deleted from state and splits
# into multiple v5 cloudflare_zone_setting resources. This causes expected initial
# drift where all v5 resources need to be created via terraform apply.
